# inventory_app

A new Flutter project.

What started as a small app idea for my mother evolved into a full-scale mobile app project—my first publicly available app! Built using the Flutter framework, this app leverages a single codebase for both Android and iOS, aiming to simplify sales and inventory tracking for micro-business owners with just 1-2 employees.  
  
Designed specifically for small, single-person businesses, the app runs entirely offline, so users don’t need an internet connection to access their data—a key feature for busy shopkeepers in my home country Nigeria. The mobile platform makes it easy to keep track of stock, sales, and trends anytime and anywhere, allowing business owners quick and easy access to their finances.  
  
Over 15 weeks, I combined A/B testing and feedback from friends and family to improve the app, helping identify bugs and optimize the UI. My goal? To give business owners like my aunt the tools to replace traditional bookkeeping and take a data-driven approach to managing their finances. With insights like sales trends, growth opportunities, and user-friendly data visualizations—and plans to integrate AI for even smarter insights—small businesses can make informed decisions and streamline operations.  
  
A huge thanks to [Durham University Venture Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/durham-university-venture-lab/) team for helping me explore potential markets and refine the app further. I'm thrilled to bring this project one step closer to its launch, and though it's not yet published on app stores, I'm actively looking for more testers.  
  
I’ve shared more about this journey and other projects on my AMALWorks YouTube channel ([https://youtube.com/@amalworks24?si=NnvTTVL-2Vwh6a1I](https://youtube.com/@amalworks24?si=NnvTTVL-2Vwh6a1I)), check it out for updates on this project ([https://youtu.be/2rbqECMOtUw?si=uyODUesiUO5dJQY1](https://youtu.be/2rbqECMOtUw?si=uyODUesiUO5dJQY1)) and any other ones I'm working on!  
  
This journey has been challenging, but the growth and knowledge I’ve gained along the way made every moment worth it! If you're interested in testing or learning more, feel free to reach out.
